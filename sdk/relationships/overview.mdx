## Overview

In modern applications, establishing relationships between users is a cornerstone of personalized and dynamic content. These relationships enable users to curate their experiences, foster community interaction, and build meaningful connections. Replyke provides two types of user relationships to suit different application needs:

### Follow Relationships
Unidirectional relationships where one user follows another (similar to Twitter/Instagram). These are ideal for:
- Social media feeds and content curation
- Creator/audience relationships
- Public content discovery
- One-way content subscriptions

### Connection Relationships
Bidirectional relationships that require mutual acceptance (similar to LinkedIn/Facebook). These are ideal for:
- Professional networking
- Mutual friendship systems
- Private or restricted content sharing
- Collaborative features requiring reciprocal relationships

Replyke simplifies the implementation of both relationship types with dedicated manager hooks:
- **`useFollowManager`**: Manages follow/unfollow relationships
- **`useConnectionManager`**: Manages connection requests, acceptance, and disconnection

Unlike other functionalities, relationships in Replyke do not require any secondary context provider. You can simply use the relationship hooks directly in any of your components.
