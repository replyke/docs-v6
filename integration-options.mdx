# Integration Options

Replyke offers two primary ways to integrate into your application, depending on your tech stack. Whether you're using React, React Native, or another framework, you can leverage Replyke's functionality in the way that best suits your needs.

<Warning>
  To use Replyke in production from a web application, make sure to whitelist
  your domain in the dashboard of your project.
</Warning>

## Using the React or React Native Client Packages (Recommended)

If your application is built with **React or React Native**, the easiest and most efficient way to integrate Replyke is through the provided client packages. These packages handle much of the complexity for you, including:

- **Authentication Handling** – Handles authentication by managing tokens and automatically refreshing them when necessary.
- **State Management** – Seamless updates and reactivity with minimal effort.
- **Optimized API Calls** – Abstracts away API interactions for a smoother developer experience.
- **UI Components (Optional)** – Includes ready-to-use, customizable, UI components.

For most developers working with React or React Native, using the client packages is the best approach as it drastically simplifies the integration process and reduces the amount of work required.

## Using the API Directly

If your application is built with a framework other than React or React Native (such as Vue, Angular, Svelte, or a backend-only implementation), you can integrate Replyke via the **API**.

This approach requires handling authentication, state management, and API calls manually, but it allows full flexibility to integrate Replyke into any tech stack.

- **Client-Side API Usage** – For frameworks other than React/React Native, simply implement Replyke by making direct API calls from your client.
- **Server-Side API Usage** – If you need Replyke functionality from the backend for operations that don't involve your client, or aren't allowed client-side, your server could also communicate with Replyke via the API using a service key that could be issued in your project's dashboard. Replyke also provides a NodeJS package to simplify the integration for you.
- **Authentication Handling** – Developers need to manage authentication manually, including storing tokens securely and refreshing them when necessary.

## Which Option Should You Choose?

| Scenario                                        | Recommended Approach                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Using React or React Native                     | Use the client packages (Recommended) |
| Using Vue, Angular, Svelte, or other frameworks | Use the API (Optionally, using the Vanilla JS package)                          |
| Server-to-server communication                  | Use the API (Optionally, using the NodeJS package)                          |

More framework integrations are currently under development.

For details on each approach, check out the **Client SDK Guide** for React/React Native or the **API Documentation** for direct API usage.
