description: "User-centric connection operations for interacting with specific users"
---

This section contains **user-centric connection operations** where you interact with connections in the context of a specific user. These endpoints are designed for operations that target a particular user by their ID.

## Purpose

User-centric connection endpoints allow developers to:
- Send connection requests to a specific user
- Check logged in user's connection status with a specific user
- Remove connections with a specific user (decline/withdraw/disconnect)
- View a specific user's connections list
- Get connection counts for any user

## Key Characteristics

- **Target-focused**: Operations target a specific user by ID
- **Requires userId parameter**: All endpoints need a specific user ID in the URL
- **Smart actions**: Single endpoint handles multiple scenarios (decline/withdraw/disconnect)
- **Authentication**: Required for all operations
- **Bidirectional**: Connections require mutual agreement

## Available Operations

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/users/:userId/connection` | POST | Send connection request to user |
| `/users/:userId/connection` | GET | Check connection status with user |
| `/users/:userId/connection` | DELETE | Decline/withdraw/disconnect with user |
| `/users/:userId/connections` | GET | Get user's connections list |
| `/users/:userId/connections-count` | GET | Get user's connections count |

## Connection Status Types

When checking connection status with a user, possible responses:
- **`none`**: No connection exists
- **`pending` (sent)**: Logged in user sent them a request
- **`pending` (received)**: They sent logged in user a request
- **`connected`**: Users are connected
- **`declined`**: Request was declined

## Smart DELETE Behavior

The `DELETE /users/:userId/connection` endpoint automatically determines the correct action:
- **Decline**: If they sent logged in user a pending request
- **Withdraw**: If logged in user sent them a pending request
- **Disconnect**: If users are connected

## Examples

**User-centric operations** (target specific users, require userId parameter):
- "Send connection request to user-123" - requires userId parameter
- "Check connection status with user-456" - requires userId parameter

**Connection-centric operations** (logged in user's data, no userId parameter):
- "Get all logged in user's established connections" - uses auth token, no userId
- "Get logged in user's pending requests" - uses auth token, no userId

## Difference from Connection-Centric Operations

**User-centric** (`/users/:userId/connections/...`):
- Operates on a **specific user** by their ID
- Requires userId parameter in the URL
- Can target any user (including public data)

**Connection-centric** (`/connections/...`):
- Operates on the **logged in user's** connection data
- Uses authentication to identify the user
- No userId parameter needed
