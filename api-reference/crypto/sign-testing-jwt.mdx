## Notes

- **For testing purposes only** - do not expose in production
- The `payload` must contain an `id` field which will be used as the `sub` in the JWT
- The signed token uses the RS256 algorithm and is valid for 5 minutes
- The audience (`aud`) is set to `replyke.com`
- No authentication required (intentionally, for testing)
- Use this endpoint to generate test tokens for local development
