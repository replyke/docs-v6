- Requires authentication
- Only the receiver of the connection request can decline it
- Updates connection status from "pending" to "declined"
- Sets the respondedAt timestamp
- Prevents the original requester from sending new requests (only receiver can re-initiate)
- No notification is sent to the requester
- Rate limiting: 50 requests per 5 minutes
