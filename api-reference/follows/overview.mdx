# Follow Operations

This section contains **follow-centric operations** for managing the logged in user's follow relationships. These endpoints focus on the logged in user's follow data and relationships.

## Purpose

Follow-centric endpoints allow developers to:
- Get lists of accounts the logged in user follows
- Get lists of accounts that follow the logged in user
- Get the logged in user's follower and following counts
- Remove specific follow relationships by follow ID

## Key Characteristics

- **Logged in user focused**: Operations on the authenticated user's follow data
- **Authentication required**: All endpoints require user authentication
- **No userId parameter**: Uses authentication to identify the user
- **List management**: Paginated lists of the logged in user's relationships

## Available Operations

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/follows/following` | GET | List accounts logged in user follows |
| `/follows/followers` | GET | List accounts that follow logged in user |
| `/follows/following-count` | GET | Get logged in user following count |
| `/follows/followers-count` | GET | Get logged in user followers count |
| `/follows/:followId` | DELETE | Remove follow by specific follow ID |

## Examples

**Follow-centric operations** (use authentication, no userId parameter):
- "Get all accounts the logged in user follows" - uses auth token
- "Get count of logged in user's followers" - uses auth token

**User-centric operations** (target specific users):
- "Get all accounts that user-123 follows" - requires userId parameter
- "Follow user-123" - requires userId parameter

## Difference from User-Centric Operations

**Follow-centric** (`/follows/...`):
- Operates on the **logged in user's** follow data
- Uses authentication to identify the user
- No userId parameter needed

**User-centric** (`/users/:userId/follows/...`):
- Operates on a **specific user** by their ID
- Requires userId parameter in the URL
- Can target any user (including public data)
