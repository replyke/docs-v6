# Why Build Social Features Into Your Product?

Giving users ways to interact with each other inside your product doesn't just add functionality—it drives engagement, retention, and a real sense of community.

Communities spark discussions, foster loyalty, and give people a reason to come back. Core features like comments, votes, feeds, relationships, collections, and in-app notifications power these interactions. They help users connect, share ideas, and feel part of something bigger.

But building all of this from scratch is time-consuming and repetitive. That's where Replyke comes in.
