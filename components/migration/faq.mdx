# Migration FAQ

Common questions about migrating from npm packages to CLI components.

---

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I still need @replyke/react-js?" icon="box">
    **Yes.** The CLI components are UI only. They depend on `@replyke/react-js` for data fetching, caching, authentication, and core functionality.

    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@replyke/react-js": "^6.0.0",
        "@replyke/ui-core-react-js": "^6.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use both npm and CLI components?" icon="code-compare">
    **Not recommended.** Pick one approach per project. Mixing them will be confusing and increase bundle size.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I've heavily customized styleCallbacks?" icon="paintbrush">
    You'll need to manually apply your customizations to the source files. Use the [Mapping Guide](/components/migration/mapping-guide) to find where each callback maps to.

    The benefit: You'll have even more control since you can customize anything, not just exposed callbacks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my existing entities/comments still work?" icon="database">
    **Yes.** The backend data is unchanged. CLI components use the same APIs and data models.

    Your existing comments, votes, and user data will work seamlessly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to migrate immediately?" icon="clock">
    **No, but recommended.** The old npm packages are deprecated but still functional. Migrate when convenient.

    New features and improvements will only be added to CLI components going forward.

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I publish my customized components?" icon="upload">
    **Yes!** It's Apache 2.0 licensed. You can fork, modify, and even publish your own variant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get updates?" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Currently: Re-run `add` to a different directory and manually merge changes.

    **Future:** A `diff` command will show what changed, making updates easier while preserving customizations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work with Next.js / Remix / Gatsby?" icon="react">
    **Yes.** CLI components are just React components. They work with any React framework.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work with TypeScript?" icon="code">
    **Yes.** All component files are `.tsx` with full type annotations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I convert between styled and tailwind?" icon="wand-sparkles">
    Manually, yes (rewrite styles). Automatically, not yet.

    **Recommendation:** Choose wisely during `init`. If you need to switch, delete components and re-add with new configuration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customization Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where do I start with customizations?" icon="paintbrush">
    1. **Colors:** Search for hex codes or Tailwind classes and replace
    2. **Layout:** Edit main component files (threaded-comment-section.tsx, etc.)
    3. **Functionality:** Edit component files and hooks

    See [Customization Guide](/components/customization/overview) for examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I broke something. How do I reset?" icon="rotate-left">
    **Option 1:** Use version control (git) to revert your changes

    ```bash
    git checkout src/components/comments-threaded/
    ```

    **Option 2:** Delete and reinstall

    ```bash
    rm -rf src/components/comments-threaded
    npx @replyke/cli add comments-threaded
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize individual files without breaking updates?" icon="file-code">
    Since there's no automatic update system yet, you won't "break" updates.

    When updates become available, you'll manually merge changes into your customized files.

    **Tip:** Comment your customizations clearly:

    ```tsx
    // CUSTOM: Changed color to match brand
    color: '#9333EA'
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
