# Replyke Components

Replyke has fundamentally changed how developers add comment systems to their applications. We've moved from the traditional **npm package approach** to a **CLI-based component distribution** system inspired by shadcn/ui.

<Info>
**The new philosophy:** Copy, paste, customize. Not install and configure.

You get **source code**, not packages. You **own** your components and can modify anything.
</Info>

---

## Why the Change?

The old npm package approach had significant limitations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Opaque Abstraction" icon="box">
    Components were black boxes in `node_modules`. Users couldn't see or modify the internal structure, logic, or sub-components without forking the entire package.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limited Customization" icon="palette">
    Only surfaces exposed via `styleCallbacks` prop could be customized. Want to change the layout? Add a new feature? Remove an element? Not possible without forking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuration Hell" icon="gears">
    Styling required passing dozens of callback functions, creating verbose and hard-to-maintain code. Simple color changes needed complex configuration objects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No True Ownership" icon="lock">
    The code lived in `node_modules`, not in your source control. Updates risked breaking changes. You were locked into the package's design decisions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The New Approach

With the CLI-based system, you get complete control:

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Replyke">
    ```bash
    npx @replyke/cli init
    ```
    Configure your platform (React/React Native), styling preference (Tailwind/Inline), and component installation path.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Components">
    ```bash
    npx @replyke/cli add comments-threaded
    # or
    npx @replyke/cli add comments-social
    ```
    Components are copied directly into your `src/components/` directory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use & Customize">
    ```tsx
    import { ThreadedCommentSection } from './components/comments-threaded';

    <ThreadedCommentSection entityId="my-post-123" />
    ```
    The component works out of the box. Want to customize? Just edit the source files directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits

| Old Approach (npm) | New Approach (CLI) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Components hidden in `node_modules` | Source code in your project |
| Limited to `styleCallbacks` prop | Edit source code directly |
| Dozens of callback functions | Minimal props |
| Can't modify layout or logic | Full control over everything |
| Package updates may break things | You control when and how to update |
| Not in version control | Committed to your repo |

## Styling Options

Each component comes in two styling variants:

### Inline Styles
- All styles as `style={{}}` objects in JSX
- No external dependencies
- Works everywhere
- Easy to find and change colors
- Theme support via conditional logic

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility classes for styling
- Requires Tailwind CSS installed
- Dark mode via `dark:` prefix
- More concise code
- Easy to integrate with design systems

Choose during `init` — you can always switch by re-installing components.

## What Gets Installed

When you add a component, you get approximately **25 TypeScript/TSX files**:

```
src/components/comments-threaded/
├── index.ts                    # Entry point
├── components/                 # All UI components (20 files)
│   ├── threaded-comment-section.tsx
│   ├── new-comment-form.tsx
│   ├── comments-feed/
│   └── modals/
├── hooks/                      # React hooks (2 files)
├── utils/                      # Utilities
└── context/                    # React context
```

Every file is:
- ✅ Visible in your project
- ✅ Editable
- ✅ TypeScript with full type annotations
- ✅ Documented with inline comments

---

## Required Dependencies

Components are **not standalone**. They depend on Replyke's core libraries for:
- Comment data fetching & caching
- Real-time updates
- Authentication integration
- Vote/like handling
- Moderation actions

**For React (Web):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@replyke/react-js": "^6.0.0",
    "@replyke/ui-core-react-js": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
```

**For React Native / Expo:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@replyke/react-native": "^6.0.0",  // or @replyke/expo
    "@replyke/ui-core-react-native": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
```

The CLI checks for these and offers to install them during `init`.

## Philosophy

The Replyke CLI follows these principles:

1. **Minimal Props** - Components work with just `entityId`. No complex configuration required.
2. **Sensible Defaults** - Beautiful, accessible styling out of the box.
3. **Edit, Don't Configure** - Customize by editing source code, not passing config objects.
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Ignore implementation details until you need to customize.
5. **Self-Documenting Code** - Clear file names, thorough comments, and color palettes documented in headers.

---

## Open Source

All components are **open source** under the Apache 2.0 license. You can:
- Fork and modify freely
- Publish your own variants
- Contribute improvements back to the community
- Use in commercial projects

## Legacy Documentation

Looking for the old npm package documentation? See the [Legacy (Deprecated)](/components/legacy/overview) section.

<Warning>
The old npm package approach (`@replyke/comments-threaded-react-js`, `@replyke/comments-social-react-js`) is deprecated. We recommend migrating to the CLI-based system for better customization and control.
</Warning>
