# Threaded Comments Features

Comprehensive feature overview for Reddit-style threaded comments.

---

## Core Features

### Unlimited Nesting

Comments can be nested infinitely deep. Users can reply to any comment, creating branching conversation threads.

```tsx
Comment 1
  └─ Reply to Comment 1
      └─ Reply to Reply
          └─ Reply to Reply to Reply
              └─ And so on...
```

**Visual indicators:**
- Indentation shows depth
- Threading lines connect replies to parents
- Each level is clearly distinguished

---

### Upvote/Downvote System

Reddit-style voting with visible vote scores.

**Features:**
- Upvote button (▲)
- Downvote button (▼)
- Net score display (upvotes - downvotes)
- Visual feedback on vote state
- Only one vote per user per comment
- Change vote or remove vote

**Authorization:**
- Only authenticated users can vote
- Can't vote on your own comments
- Duplicate votes prevented automatically

---

### Visual Threading

Clear visual hierarchy with indentation and connection lines.

**Default spacing:**
- Each reply level indented by 16px
- Threading lines show parent-child relationships
- Collapsible threads to hide long chains

**Customizable:**
Edit `indentation-threading-lines.tsx` to adjust spacing, colors, or line styles.

---

### Collapsible Threads

Users can collapse/expand entire comment chains.

**How it works:**
- Click [-] to collapse a comment and all its replies
- Click [+] to expand a collapsed thread
- Collapsed state shows reply count
- Useful for navigating long discussions

---

### @ Mentions

Tag other users with `@username`.

**Features:**
- Autocomplete suggestions as you type
- Clickable mentions navigate to user profiles
- Mentioned users receive notifications (if enabled)
- Works in both comments and replies

**Implementation:**
- `mention-suggestions.tsx` handles autocomplete
- Mentions are parsed and linked automatically
- Integrates with your `otherUserClickCallback`

---

### Highlighted Comments

Deep-link to specific comments with visual highlighting.

**Use cases:**
- Notification links ("John replied to your comment")
- URL params (`?commentId=abc123`)
- Drawing attention to specific comments

**How it works:**
```tsx
<ThreadedCommentSection
  foreignId="post_123"
  highlightedCommentId="comment_abc"
/>
```

The component:
1. Scrolls to the highlighted comment
2. Applies a highlight background color
3. Fades the highlight after a few seconds

---

### Edit & Delete

Comment authors can edit or delete their own comments.

**Edit:**
- Click "Edit" from action menu
- Modify comment text inline
- Save or cancel changes
- Shows "edited" indicator

**Delete:**
- Click "Delete" from action menu
- Confirmation dialog (customizable)
- Soft delete (comment shows "[deleted]")
- Preserves thread structure

**Authorization:**
- Only comment author can edit/delete
- Moderators/admins have additional permissions (via dashboard)

---

### Reporting & Moderation

Built-in reporting system for inappropriate content.

**User perspective:**
- Click "Report" from action menu
- Select reason (spam, harassment, etc.)
- Submit report

**Admin perspective:**
- Reports appear in Replyke dashboard
- Review and take action (delete comment, ban user)
- Full moderation toolkit

---

### Loading States

Skeleton loaders while fetching comments.

**Features:**
- Realistic skeleton UI mimics comment structure
- Smooth transition when data loads
- Prevents layout shift

**File:** `fetching-comments-skeletons.tsx`

---

### Empty States

Friendly placeholder when no comments exist.

**Default message:** "No comments yet. Be the first to comment!"

**Customization:**
Edit `no-comments-placeholder.tsx` to change messaging or add illustrations.

---

### Real-Time Updates

Comments automatically update when new comments are added by other users.

**Powered by:**
- `@replyke/react-js` real-time subscriptions
- WebSocket connections
- Automatic cache invalidation

**No configuration needed** — works out of the box.

---

### Dark Mode Support

Full dark mode support with automatic color switching.

**Inline Styles Variant:**
```tsx
<ThreadedCommentSection
  foreignId="post_123"
  theme={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'}
/>
```

**Tailwind Variant:**
```tsx
<html className={isDark ? 'dark' : ''}>
  <ThreadedCommentSection foreignId="post_123" />
</html>
```

All colors adapt automatically.

---

### GIF Support (Optional)

Enable GIF picker in comment forms.

**Setup:**
1. Add Giphy API key in [Replyke Dashboard](https://dash.replyke.com)
2. GIF picker automatically appears in comment forms
3. Users can search and insert GIFs

**No code changes needed** — enabled via dashboard configuration.

---

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels
- Focus management
- Screen reader friendly
