## Styling Variants

Threaded comments are available in two styling options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tailwind CSS">
    Uses Tailwind utility classes for styling.

    **Requires:** Tailwind CSS installed in your project

    **Example:**
    ```tsx
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-600">
    ```

    **Best for:** Projects using Tailwind, design system integration
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Inline Styles">
    Uses inline `style={{}}` objects with conditional dark mode logic.

    **Requires:** Nothing additional

    **Example:**
    ```tsx
    <div style={{
      backgroundColor: theme === 'dark' ? '#1F2937' : '#FFFFFF',
      padding: '16px',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      border: `1px solid ${theme === 'dark' ? '#4B5563' : '#E5E7EB'}`
    }}>
    ```

    **Best for:** Projects without Tailwind, explicit styling
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Choose your preference during `npx @replyke/cli init`.
