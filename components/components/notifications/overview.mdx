## What It's NOT

<Warning>
This is **not** a full-page notifications center or inbox. It's a dropdown control component designed for navigation bars and headers.

For a full notifications page, use the `useAppNotifications` hook from `@replyke/react-js` to build your custom interface.
</Warning>

---

## Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- Navigation bar notification bells
- Header dropdown notifications
- Real-time notification alerts
- Social media style notification systems
- SaaS dashboard notifications

**File Complexity:**
- **5 files total** (much simpler than comment components)
- Minimal state management
- Easy to customize

---

## Notification Types Supported

The component supports various notification types with appropriate icons:

| Type | Icon | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| `system` | Wrench | System announcements |
| `entity-comment` | MessageCircle | New comment on entity |
| `comment-reply` | MessageSquare | Reply to your comment |
| `entity-mention` | @ | Mentioned in entity |
| `comment-mention` | @ | Mentioned in comment |
| `entity-upvote` | Heart | Upvote on entity |
| `comment-upvote` | Heart | Upvote on comment |

## Styling Variants

Like all Replyke CLI components, NotificationControl comes in two styling options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inline Styles">
    All styles as `style={{}}` objects with OKLCH color space.

    **Features:**
    - No CSS dependencies
    - Theme controlled via `theme` prop (`"auto" | "light" | "dark"`)
    - Works everywhere
    - Better color accuracy with OKLCH

    **Example:**
    ```tsx
    <NotificationControl
      theme="auto"  // or "light" | "dark"
      {...props}
    />
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Tailwind CSS">
    Uses Tailwind utility classes for styling.

    **Features:**
    - Requires Tailwind CSS
    - Dark mode via `dark:` prefix
    - More concise code
    - Requires `darkMode: 'class'` in config

    **Example:**
    ```tsx
    <html className={isDark ? 'dark' : ''}>
      <NotificationControl {...props} />
    </html>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Choose your preference during `npx @replyke/cli init`.
