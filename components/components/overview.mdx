## When to Use Threaded Comments

Choose **Threaded Comments** when you need:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deep Discussions" icon="messages">
    Forums, technical discussions, and detailed conversations benefit from unlimited nesting. Users can reply to specific points deep in a thread.

    **Example use cases:**
    - Developer forums
    - Blog posts with technical content
    - Q&A platforms
    - Community discussions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vote-Based Ranking" icon="arrow-up">
    Upvotes and downvotes help surface quality content and hide low-quality contributions. Scores provide social proof.

    **Example use cases:**
    - Reddit-style communities
    - News sites
    - Content aggregators
    - User-generated content platforms
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Visual Hierarchy" icon="sitemap">
    Threading lines and indentation make it easy to follow complex conversation flows and see which comments are responding to what.

    **Example use cases:**
    - Long discussions
    - Debates
    - Multi-topic threads
    - Complex conversations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## When to Use Social Comments

Choose **Social Comments** when you need:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick Interactions" icon="bolt">
    Simple, fast commenting without deep nesting. Perfect for social media-style engagement.

    **Example use cases:**
    - Photo/video sharing platforms
    - Social media apps
    - Short-form content
    - Mobile-first experiences
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Positive-Only Engagement" icon="heart">
    Hearts/likes promote positive interactions without the negativity of downvotes. Better for community culture in some contexts.

    **Example use cases:**
    - Instagram-style apps
    - Creator platforms
    - Positive communities
    - Brand engagement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean, Minimal Design" icon="sparkles">
    Flat, uncluttered interface that doesn't distract from content. Better for mobile and visual-first platforms.

    **Example use cases:**
    - Mobile apps
    - Visual content platforms
    - Minimalist designs
    - Content-first experiences
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Can I Use Both?

Yes! You can install both component types in the same project and use them on different pages or for different content types.

```bash
# Install both
npx @replyke/cli add comments-threaded
npx @replyke/cli add comments-social
```

Then use whichever fits best:

```tsx
// For blog posts - use threaded
import { ThreadedCommentSection } from './components/comments-threaded';

function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Article content={post.content} />
      <ThreadedCommentSection entityId={post.id} />
    </>
  );
}

// For photos - use social
import { SocialCommentSection } from './components/comments-social';

function PhotoPost({ photo }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Image src={photo.url} />
      <SocialCommentSection entityId={photo.id} />
    </>
  );
}
```

<Info>
Both component types will be installed in separate directories and won't conflict with each other.
