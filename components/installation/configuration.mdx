# Configuration File

The `replyke.json` file is created in your project root during initialization. It stores your preferences and is used by the CLI when adding components.

---

## File Location

```
your-project/
├── package.json
├── replyke.json          ← Configuration file
├── src/
│   └── components/
└── ...
```

---

## Configuration Schema

```json
{
  "platform": "react" | "react-native" | "expo",
  "style": "tailwind" | "styled",
  "typescript": true | false,
  "paths": {
    "components": "src/components"
  },
  "aliases": {
    "@/components": "./src/components"
  }
}
```

---

## Configuration Options

### `platform`

**Type:** `"react"` | `"react-native"` | `"expo"`

**Description:** Specifies your application platform. This determines:
- Which component variants are available
- Which peer dependencies are required
- Platform-specific imports and syntax

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "platform": "react"
}
```

For React web applications.

```json
{
  "platform": "react-native"
}
```

For React Native mobile applications.

```json
{
  "platform": "expo"
}
```

For Expo-managed projects.

---

### `style`

**Type:** `"tailwind"` | `"styled"`

**Description:** Determines which styling approach to use for components.

**Options:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="tailwind">
    Components use Tailwind CSS utility classes.

    ```json
    {
      "style": "tailwind"
    }
    ```

    **Requires:** Tailwind CSS installed in your project

    **Example component code:**
    ```tsx
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
      <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">Username</span>
    </div>
    ```

    **Best for:**
    - Projects already using Tailwind CSS
    - Design systems based on Tailwind
    - Developers who prefer utility-first CSS
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="styled (Inline Styles)">
    Components use inline `style={{}}` objects.

    ```json
    {
      "style": "styled"
    }
    ```

    **Requires:** Nothing additional

    **Example component code:**
    ```tsx
    <div style={{
      backgroundColor: theme === 'dark' ? '#1F2937' : '#FFFFFF',
      padding: '16px',
      borderRadius: '8px'
    }}>
      <span style={{ color: '#2563EB', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Username</span>
    </div>
    ```

    **Best for:**
    - Projects without Tailwind CSS
    - Explicit, self-contained styling
    - Developers who prefer inline styles
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Once you've added components with a specific style variant, switching requires re-installing the components. You can change `style` in `replyke.json` and then delete and re-add components.
</Warning>

---

### `typescript`

**Type:** `boolean`

**Default:** `true` (detected automatically)

**Description:** Indicates whether your project uses TypeScript. This is automatically detected based on your project setup.

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "typescript": true
}
```

For TypeScript projects (`.tsx` files).

```json
{
  "typescript": false
}
```

For JavaScript projects (`.jsx` files).

<Info>
The CLI auto-detects this from your `tsconfig.json` or file extensions. You rarely need to change this manually.
</Info>

---

### `paths`

**Type:** `object`

**Description:** Configures where different types of files should be installed.

**Properties:**

- `components` - The directory where CLI components will be installed

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "components": "src/components"
  }
}
```

Components will be installed at:
- `src/components/comments-threaded/`
- `src/components/comments-social/`

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "components": "app/ui/components"
  }
}
```

Components will be installed at:
- `app/ui/components/comments-threaded/`
- `app/ui/components/comments-social/`

<Note>
Use a path relative to your project root. The CLI will create the directory if it doesn't exist.
</Note>

---

### `aliases`

**Type:** `object`

**Description:** Path aliases used in component imports. These match your project's path resolution configuration (tsconfig.json paths or webpack aliases).

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "@/components": "./src/components"
  }
}
```

Components will use imports like:
```tsx
import { SomeUtil } from '@/components/utils';
```

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "~/components": "./app/components"
  }
}
```

Components will use imports like:
```tsx
import { SomeUtil } from '~/components/utils';
```

<Warning>
Make sure these aliases match your `tsconfig.json` or bundler configuration. Mismatched aliases will cause import errors.
</Warning>

---

## Complete Example

Here's a typical `replyke.json` for a React web app using Tailwind CSS:

```json
{
  "platform": "react",
  "style": "tailwind",
  "typescript": true,
  "paths": {
    "components": "src/components"
  },
  "aliases": {
    "@/components": "./src/components"
  }
}
```

---

## Changing Configuration

### Option 1: Edit Manually

You can edit `replyke.json` directly:

```json
{
  "platform": "react",
  "style": "styled",  // Changed from "tailwind" to "styled"
  "typescript": true,
  "paths": {
    "components": "src/components"
  },
  "aliases": {
    "@/components": "./src/components"
  }
}
```

Then re-run `add` commands to install components with the new configuration.

<Warning>
If you've already added components, you'll need to delete them first:

```bash
rm -rf src/components/comments-threaded
rm -rf src/components/comments-social

npx @replyke/cli add comments-threaded
```
</Warning>

### Option 2: Re-initialize

Delete `replyke.json` and run `init` again:

```bash
rm replyke.json
npx @replyke/cli init
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use both styling variants in the same project?" icon="question">
    No, the configuration applies to all components. Pick one approach and stick with it for consistency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I delete replyke.json?" icon="trash">
    The CLI will error when you try to `add` components. Simply run `npx @replyke/cli init` again to recreate it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the configuration schema?" icon="code">
    No, the CLI expects this specific schema. However, you can request new options by opening an issue on GitHub.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this file affect my application at runtime?" icon="play">
    No, `replyke.json` is only used by the CLI during component installation. Your application doesn't read or use this file.
