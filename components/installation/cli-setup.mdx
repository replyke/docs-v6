# Installing the Replyke CLI

The Replyke CLI is your gateway to adding fully customizable comment components to your application. You can use it directly with `npx` (no installation needed) or install it globally for convenience.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Node.js 18+">
    The CLI requires Node.js version 18 or higher.

    ```bash
    node --version
    # Should output v18.x.x or higher
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="A React Project">
    You'll need an existing React, React Native, or Expo project.

    Supported platforms:
    - React (Web) ✅
    - React Native ✅
    - Expo ✅
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replyke Project">
    Create a project in the [Replyke Dashboard](https://dash.replyke.com) if you haven't already.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Using npx (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the CLI is with `npx` — no installation required:

```bash
npx @replyke/cli init
```

This approach ensures you're always using the latest version of the CLI.

---

## Global Installation (Optional)

If you prefer, you can install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @replyke/cli
```

Then use it without `npx`:

```bash
replyke init
replyke add comments-threaded
```

<Note>
For the rest of this documentation, we'll use `npx @replyke/cli` to be version-agnostic, but you can use `replyke` if you've installed globally.
</Note>

---

## Initializing Your Project

Run the initialization command in your project directory:

```bash
cd your-react-app
npx @replyke/cli init
```

### Interactive Prompts

The CLI will ask you a series of questions to configure your project:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Platform Selection" icon="layer-group">
    **Question:** "Which platform are you using?"

    **Options:**
    - React (Web)
    - React Native
    - Expo

    **What it does:** Determines which component variants and dependencies to use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Styling Preference" icon="palette">
    **Question:** "Which styling approach do you prefer?"

    **Options:**
    - **Tailwind CSS** - Uses utility classes like `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`
    - **Inline Styles** - Uses style objects like `style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'dark' ? '#1F2937' : '#FFFFFF' }}`

    **What it does:** Determines which component variant you'll receive.

    **Recommendation:**
    - Choose **Tailwind** if your project already uses Tailwind CSS
    - Choose **Inline Styles** if you don't use Tailwind or prefer explicit styling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Component Path" icon="folder">
    **Question:** "Where should components be installed?"

    **Default:** `src/components`

    **What it does:** Sets the directory where CLI components will be copied.

    **Note:** You can use any path, but `src/components` is conventional.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Happens During Init

The initialization process:

1. **Detects your project type** based on your `package.json`
2. **Creates `replyke.json`** configuration file in your project root
3. **Checks for required peer dependencies:**
   - `@replyke/react-js` and `@replyke/ui-core-react-js` (React Web)
   - `@replyke/react-native` and `@replyke/ui-core-react-native` (React Native)
   - `@replyke/expo` and `@replyke/ui-core-react-native` (Expo)
4. **Offers to install missing dependencies** if needed

---

## The replyke.json File

After initialization, you'll see a `replyke.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "platform": "react",
  "style": "tailwind",
  "typescript": true,
  "paths": {
    "components": "src/components"
  },
  "aliases": {
    "@/components": "./src/components"
  }
}
```

This file stores your configuration and is used by subsequent `add` commands.

<Info>
You can manually edit this file to change your preferences. Just re-run `add` commands to install components with the new configuration.
</Info>

See [Configuration](/components/installation/configuration) for more details on this file.

---

## Installing Dependencies

The CLI will check for required peer dependencies and prompt you to install them if missing.

### For React (Web)

```bash
npm install @replyke/react-js
```

### For React Native

```bash
npm install @replyke/react-native
```

### For Expo

```bash
npm install @replyke/expo
```

<Warning>
These dependencies are **required**. Components use them for data fetching, caching, real-time updates, authentication, and core functionality.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Node version too old" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    ```
    Error: The Replyke CLI requires Node.js 18 or higher
    ```

    **Solution:** Upgrade Node.js to version 18 or higher.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Not a valid project directory" icon="folder-xmark">
    ```
    Error: No package.json found
    ```

    **Solution:** Run the command from your project root directory where `package.json` is located.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CLI hangs or doesn't respond" icon="hourglass">
    **Solution:**
    1. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel
    2. Clear npx cache: `npx clear-npx-cache`
    3. Try again: `npx @replyke/cli init`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Want to change configuration" icon="gear">
    **Solution:**
    1. Delete `replyke.json`
    2. Run `npx @replyke/cli init` again
    3. Or manually edit `replyke.json` and re-run `add` commands
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
