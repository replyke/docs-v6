<Warning>
**This section contains deprecated documentation** for the old npm package approach (`@replyke/comments-threaded-react-js`, `@replyke/comments-social-react-js`).

These packages still work but are **no longer recommended**. We've moved to a CLI-based component distribution system that gives you full source code ownership and unlimited customization.
</Warning>

---

# Legacy Component Documentation

This section preserves documentation for developers still using the old npm packages.

---

## Why These Are Deprecated

The npm package approach had significant limitations:

- **Limited customization:** Only surfaces exposed via `styleCallbacks` could be styled
- **Complex configuration:** Dozens of callback functions required for styling
- **Hidden code:** Components lived in `node_modules`, not visible or editable
- **Version lock-in:** Updates could break your implementation
- **No layout control:** Couldn't rearrange, remove, or add UI elements

---

## Recommended Migration Path

We **strongly recommend** migrating to the new CLI-based approach:

## Still Have Questions?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why should I migrate?" icon="question">
    The CLI approach gives you:
    - Full source code ownership
    - Unlimited customization (not just styleCallbacks)
    - Simpler API (no complex props)
    - Better version control
    - Ability to modify layout and functionality

    See the [Migration Guide](/components/migration/npm-to-cli) for full details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long will legacy packages be supported?" icon="clock">
    Legacy packages will receive **security fixes only**. No new features or improvements will be added.

    We recommend migrating when convenient, but there's no immediate deadline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my data migrate?" icon="database">
    **Yes.** Your existing entities, comments, votes, and user data work seamlessly with CLI components. The backend is unchanged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is migration difficult?" icon="wrench">
    Migration is straightforward:
    1. Install CLI components
    2. Update imports
    3. Remove styleCallbacks prop
    4. Apply customizations in source files

    Most projects can migrate in under 30 minutes.
