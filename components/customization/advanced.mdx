# Advanced Customization

Deeper customizations involving hooks, context, and utilities.

---

## Modify Hooks

Components use hooks from the `/hooks/` directory. You can customize these for advanced behavior changes.

### Example: Change Default Sorting

```tsx
// File: hooks/use-threaded-comments.tsx

const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('top');  // Change from 'best' to 'top'
```

---

## Customize Context

Modify context providers for app-wide state changes.

```tsx
// File: context/ui-state-context.tsx

// Add custom state
const [customState, setCustomState] = useState(initialValue);
```

---

## Add Custom Utilities

Create new utility files in the `/utils/` directory for shared logic.

```tsx
// File: utils/analytics.ts

export const trackCommentEvent = (event: string, data: any) => {
  // Your analytics implementation
};
```

---

## Integrate with Your Systems

Wire components to your existing systems:

- Authentication
- User profiles
- Analytics
- Error tracking
- Custom APIs
