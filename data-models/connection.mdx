# Connection Object

The **Connection** object represents a bidirectional relationship between users in the Replyke social features framework. Unlike follows, connections require mutual agreement between two users and represent equal partnerships similar to Facebook friends or LinkedIn connections.

## Properties

| **Property**  | **Type**                                | **Description**                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `string`                                | Unique identifier for the connection (UUID)             |
| `projectId`   | `string`                                | Identifier of the associated project (UUID)             |
| `requesterId` | `string`                                | ID of the user who initiated the connection request     |
| `receiverId`  | `string`                                | ID of the user who received the connection request      |
| `status`      | `'pending' \| 'accepted' \| 'declined'` | Current status of the connection                         |
| `message`     | `string \| null`                        | Optional message with the connection request             |
| `respondedAt` | `Date \| null`                          | Timestamp when the request was responded to (accept/decline) |
| `createdAt`   | `Date`                                  | Timestamp when the request was sent                     |

## Status Definitions

| **Status**  | **Description**              | **Initiator Actions**    | **Receiver Actions**     | **Notes**                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `pending`   | Request sent, awaiting response | Can withdraw            | Can accept/decline       | Active request state             |
| `accepted`  | Connection established       | Equal partners           | Equal partners           | Bidirectional relationship       |
| `declined`  | Request rejected             | Cannot re-request        | Can delete & create new  | Only receiver can re-initiate    |

## Characteristics

### Bidirectional Relationship
- **Mutual Agreement**: Requires approval from both parties
- **Equal Partnership**: Once accepted, both users have equal status
- **Request/Response Workflow**: Structured approval process
- **Complete History**: Maintains full interaction history

### Business Rules
1. **Single Model Approach**: One model handles requests and established connections
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Only one active connection between any two users
3. **Re-request Logic**: After decline, only receiver can initiate new requests
4. **Status Transitions**: Clear progression from pending → accepted/declined

---

## User Model Associations

The Connection model creates two associations with the User model:

```typescript
// User hasMany Connection as "sentConnections" (as requester)
User.hasMany(Connection, {
  foreignKey: "requesterId",
  as: "sentConnections",
  onDelete: "CASCADE"
});

// User hasMany Connection as "receivedConnections" (as receiver)
User.hasMany(Connection, {
  foreignKey: "receiverId",
  as: "receivedConnections",
  onDelete: "CASCADE"
});
```

## API Endpoints

### User-Centric Operations
- `POST /users/:userId/connection` - Send connection request to user
- `GET /users/:userId/connection` - Get connection status with user
- `DELETE /users/:userId/connection` - Decline/withdraw/disconnect with user
- `GET /users/:userId/connections` - Get connections of specific user
- `GET /users/:userId/connections-count` - Get connections count for specific user

### Connection-Centric Operations
- `GET /connections` - List established connections
- `GET /connections/count` - Get connections count
- `GET /connections/pending/sent` - List sent pending requests
- `GET /connections/pending/received` - List received pending requests
- `PUT /connections/:connectionId/accept` - Accept specific connection
- `PUT /connections/:connectionId/decline` - Decline specific connection
- `DELETE /connections/:connectionId` - Remove specific connection

---

## Status Transitions

### Valid Transitions
```
pending → accepted (by receiver)
pending → declined (by receiver)
pending → [DELETED] (by requester - withdraw)
accepted → [DELETED] (by either - disconnect)
declined → [DELETED] (by receiver only - to allow re-request)
```

### Invalid Transitions
- `declined → accepted` (must delete and create new request)
- Cannot change status once responded (except delete for disconnect/re-request)

---

## Usage Examples

### Sending Connection Request
```json
POST /users/user-123/connection
Body: { "message": "Hi! I'd like to connect." }
→ Creates Connection with status="pending", requesterId=current-user, receiverId=user-123
```

### Accepting Connection
```json
PUT /connections/connection-uuid/accept
→ Updates status to "accepted", sets respondedAt timestamp
```

### Checking Connection Status
```json
GET /users/user-123/connection
→ Returns detailed status: none/pending/connected/declined with metadata
```

## Notification Strategy

| **Event**            | **Notify Who** | **Type**     | **Notes**              |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Request Sent         | Receiver       | In-app only  | `connection-request`   |
| Request Accepted     | Requester      | In-app only  | `connection-accepted`  |
| Request Declined     | No one         | None         | No notification sent   |
| Connection Removed   | No one         | None         | No notification sent   |

---

## Query Patterns

### Get User's Connections (Bidirectional)
```sql
-- User is connected if they are requester OR receiver with accepted status
SELECT * FROM Connections
WHERE projectId = ?
  AND status = 'accepted'
  AND (requesterId = ? OR receiverId = ?)
```

### Get Pending Requests
```sql
-- Received requests
SELECT * FROM Connections
WHERE projectId = ? AND receiverId = ? AND status = 'pending'

-- Sent requests
SELECT * FROM Connections
WHERE projectId = ? AND requesterId = ? AND status = 'pending'
```

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexes**: Optimized for queries by requesterId, receiverId, status, and projectId
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
- **Rate Limiting**: Connection requests limited to 25 requests per 5 minutes
- **Caching**: Consider caching connection counts and lists for active users

---

## Related Models

- **User**: The users involved in the connection relationship
- **Follow**: One-way relationship alternative that doesn't require approval
- **AppNotification**: Notifications for connection requests and acceptances
