## Setting Up a Webhook for App Notifications

When a new app notification is created by Replyke, developers can configure their server to be notified about the event. This is achieved by setting up a webhook endpoint on the developer’s server. A webhook is essentially an HTTP endpoint that is triggered by Replyke whenever a notification is generated. The webhook will receive a payload containing all the relevant details about the notification, enabling developers to send corresponding push notifications or perform other actions.

---

### Notification Payload Details

The payload sent to the webhook contains the following details:

| **Field**       | **Description**                                                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `projectId`     | The ID of the project that generated the notification.                                                    |
| `userId`        | The ID of the user who is the recipient of the notification.                                              |
| `type`          | A string representing the event type (e.g., `entity-comment`, `comment-reply`, `entity-mention`, etc.).    |
| `action`        | A recommended action to take, such as `open-entity`, `open-comment`, or `open-profile`.                   |
| `metadata`      | A payload containing additional details relevant to the notification. Refer to the notification types table for specifics in the "Notification Templates" chapter. |

### Securing Your Webhook

<Callout type="info">
 Verifying the integrity of a notification - covered in more detail below - is similar to verifying other webhooks, such as those triggered when an entity or user is created or updated, as discussed in the security section of this documentation.
</Callout>

To ensure the integrity of the data received by your webhook, Replyke uses a secure signing mechanism:

1. **Generate a Secret Key:** Developers must generate a secret key in their project’s dashboard and store it securely as an environment variable on their server.

2. **Payload Signing:** Before sending the notification details to the webhook, Replyke signs the payload using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. This process uses the secret key to create a signature.

3. **Verification:** The webhook server must verify the payload using the same secret key to confirm that the request originated from Replyke. Any request with an invalid signature should be rejected.

### Example: Verifying a Webhook in Node.js + Express

Here is an example implementation of a webhook in a Node.js + Express environment:

#### Webhook Controller

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import { validateIncomingHmac } from "./utility-functions";

export default async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const sharedSecret = process.env.REPLYKE_WEBHOOKS_SECRET;
  try {
    // Step 1: Validate the incoming HMAC signature
    validateIncomingHmac(req, sharedSecret!);

    const newNotificationData = req.body;

    // Step 2: Process the data as needed. There is no need to send a response.
    console.log({ newNotificationData });

  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error("Error validating webhook: ", err);
    // Respond with an error status
    res.status(400).send({ error: "Invalid webhook request" });
  }
};
```

#### Utility Function for Validation

```typescript
import crypto from "crypto";
import { Request } from "express";

/**
 * Validate HMAC signature of an incoming request.
 */
export function validateIncomingHmac(req: Request, secret: string): void {
  const signature = req.headers["x-signature"] as string;
  const timestamp = req.headers["x-timestamp"] as string;

  if (!signature || !timestamp) {
    throw new Error("Missing HMAC signature or timestamp in headers");
  }

  // Reject requests older than 5 minutes to prevent replay attacks
  if (Date.now() - parseInt(timestamp, 10) > 5 * 60 * 1000) {
    throw new Error("Request timestamp expired");
  }

  // Compute the expected signature
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(`${timestamp}.${payload}`)
    .digest("hex");

  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    throw new Error("Invalid HMAC signature");
  }
}
```

### Steps to Integrate the Webhook

1. **Set Up Your Webhook Endpoint:** Create an HTTP endpoint on your server to receive the notification payloads.

2. **Generate and Store Your Secret Key:** Go to the Replyke project dashboard to generate a secret key and store it securely as an environment variable.

3. **Implement Payload Validation:** Use the provided example to validate incoming requests using the secret key, or implement a similar HMAC validation logic in your preferred programming language if you are not using Node.js.

4. **Handle the Notification Data:** Use the payload details to trigger appropriate actions, such as sending push notifications to users.

5. **Monitor and Debug** (*Optional*): Log incoming requests and errors to ensure the webhook is functioning correctly.

By following these steps, you can reliably integrate a secure webhook into your system, ensuring trusted communication between your server and Replyke.
