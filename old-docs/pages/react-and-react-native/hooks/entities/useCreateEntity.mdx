# `useCreateEntity`

## Overview
The `useCreateEntity` hook is used to create a new entity within the project. It handles all required parameters for the creation process and associates the entity with the currently logged-in user.


## Usage Example

```tsx
import { useCreateEntity } from "@replyke/react-js";

function CreateEntityForm() {
  const createEntity = useCreateEntity();

  const handleCreateEntity = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await createEntity({
        title: "My New Entity",
        content: "This is the content of the entity.",
        media: ["https://example.com/image.jpg"],
        keywords: ["example", "entity"],
        location: { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060 },
        metadata: { category: "blog" },
      });

      console.log("Entity created successfully:", result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to create entity:", error.message);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleCreateEntity}>Create Entity</button>;
}
```
