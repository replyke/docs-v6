import { useFetchUserSuggestions } from "@replyke/react-js";

function UserSuggestions({ query }: { query: string }) {
  const fetchUserSuggestions = useFetchUserSuggestions();

  const handleFetchSuggestions = async () => {
    try {
      const suggestions = await fetchUserSuggestions({ query });
      console.log("User suggestions:", suggestions);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch user suggestions:", error.message);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleFetchSuggestions}>Get User Suggestions</button>;
}
```
